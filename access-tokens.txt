Access Token - 

An access token is an object encapsulating the security identity of a 
process or thread. An access token contains the security credentials for 
a login session and identifies the user, the user's groups, the user's 
privileges, and, in some cases, a particular application. The access 
token should be used as a bearer credential and transmitted in an HTTP 
authorization header to the API.
