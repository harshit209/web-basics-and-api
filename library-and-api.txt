Difference between Library, Framework and API

A library is a collection of functions / objects that serves one 
particular purpose. you could use a library in a variety of projects.
For example, a Bitmap Processing library will provide facilities for 
loading and manipulating bitmap images, saving you having to write all 
that code for yourself.

A framework is a collection of patterns and libraries to help with 
building an application.
For example, .NET provides an application framework

An API is an interface for other programs to interact with your program 
without having direct access.

To put it another way, think of a library as an add-on / piece of an 
application , a framework as the skeleton of the application, and an API 
as an outward-facing part of said app.

In the context of Android Development:

Library: android.app.Activity library (Class with all code)
API: Android API to interact with hardware, like the front camera of an 
Android-based device. If your app needs to vibrate the phone, you must 
use the Android API method like vibratePhone()
